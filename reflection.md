# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design
-- Sarai --
three core actions: add a pet, schedule event, did the pet eat, walk, meds, etc

attributes: pet type, breed, age, name, 
methods: go on walk, takemeds, addevent, getschedule


**a. Initial design**

- Briefly describe your initial UML design.
- What classes did you include, and what responsibilities did you assign to each?

The initial design of the UML is a easy way to take all the pet's needs and builds a daily schedule for the owner based on the time and priorities. The classes I have are Owner, Pet, Task, Scheduler, and ScheduledTask. The owner has a pet and pet can have 0 or more tasks. The scheduler plans for the owner and produces a ScheduledTask which then gives these Tasks to the pet. 


**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.

I did make some design changes during implementation. I changed the TIME_OF_DAY_MAP to prevents a runtime error by inlining values, and the add_event_to_schedule docstring shows expected behavior when no scheduler exists. I also made some improvements like changing ScheduledTask.pet_name to a Pet reference and adding a frequency field to Task ensure data stays consistent and supports recurring scheduling. Finally, clear_completed_tasks() and reset_plan() were added to prevent data buildup and duplication, keeping the system clean across multiple scheduling runs.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?

## 5. Reflection

**a. What went well**

- What part of this project are you most satisfied with?

**b. What you would improve**

- If you had another iteration, what would you improve or redesign?

**c. Key takeaway**

- What is one important thing you learned about designing systems or working with AI on this project?
